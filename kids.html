        <p id="baseP">Before buying kids dresses make sure you know the correct size that fits your child</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p id="baseP">Size is the most important factor when you are buying a baby dress. Toddlers grow very fast and so if you are buying the 0-3 months size, you would have to replace that soon. Buy only what is absolutely necessary. You could also consider buying a bigger size so that your baby can wear it for a longer time.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="baseP">Before you start shopping, it is important that you have your kid’s exact measurement in place. You then can compare it with the size chart while making a purchase. Whether you’re buying online or buying from a brick-and-mortar store, this is really important. Kids’ do not really like trying out clothes in the store as you can avoid a scene by knowing your child’s exact measurement. Also, remember that the sizes of one brand might differ from the other.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="baseP">Know your child's wardrobe</p>
        <br>
        <p id="baseP">It is common for parents to go on a shopping spree when it comes to buying kids dresses. However, in most cases, you will find out that you either are buying things that your kid already has or you are buying stuff that your kid does not need.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="baseP">So, before you start shopping for <a href="https://www.snapdeal.com/products/kids-clothing?sort=plrty" id="anchor">kids dress and accessories</a>, make sure you have gone through your kid’s wardrobe thoroughly. Check the closets and all the drawer as well. Keep the outgrown and shabby clothes out and then take a note of what is missing or what you need to buy more. For example, if you make your kid wear t-shirts every day, then make sure that there are at least 8-10 good t-shirts in the wardrobe. You probably won’t be doing the laundry every day. So, having enough to last a week is important.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="baseP">For kids dresses comfort is important and so is the weather</p>
        <br>
        <p id="baseP">Once you are shopping, the most important factor that you need to consider is the comfort. If you are buying baby clothes like winter wear, you need to make sure that the new clothes do not hamper your baby’s activities in any way. The fabric should be soft on your baby’s skin and she should be able to swing her legs and arms freely in her dress. The dress should also be easy to open as well. This might sound weird but there are clothes that are not safe for babies. Avoid clothes that come with zipper closure as it might harm your little one’s delicate skin. Avoid clothes with loose buttons as your baby might swallow them. In short, for babies, look for clothes with minimum embellishment unless you are making her wear it for a very short time and you can always keep an eye on her.</p>
